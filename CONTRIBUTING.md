## Collision
*This is the gene symbol that represents more than one gene*

## Collision Class
*A description of the relationship between the genes that share the collision*
the data field in which the collision occurs

## Collision Type
*Either alias-alias, if the collision is shared as an alias between genes, or alias-primary, if the collision is shared as an alias and primary gene symbol between genes*

## Collision Group: 
*A description of the genes in the collision group*

### Gene Symbol 
*Primary gene symbol of the gene being represented by the collision*

### ENSG ID
*Unique identifier number assigned by Ensembl to each gene, begining with ENSG*

### Genomic Location (GRCh38/hg38)
*A description of the location of the gene on assembly GRCh38/hg38 including the chromosome, start position, and end position*

### Gene Size
*The size of the gene in bases based on the GRCh38 assembly*

### Cytogenetic Location
*A description of the location of the gene including the chromosome, the arm of the chromosome (q or p), and the position of the gene on the arm*

### Collision Gene Relationship:
*A description characterizing the relationship between the collision and the gene*

#### Collision Acronym Expansion 
*An explanation for what the letters in the collision stand for with the symbol letters capitalized in the expansion* 

#### Collision Association
*The association that the collision has with the gene. For example, it might be the gene's primary symbol. If it is the gene's alias, which aspect of the gene is it describing? Some examples include protein product, function, gene family, protein domain, etc*

#### Collision Source
*PMID of the publication(s) that use the collision to describe this gene*
