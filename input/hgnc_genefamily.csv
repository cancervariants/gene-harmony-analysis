Originally coined to describe the finger-like appearance of a hypothesized structure from Xenopus laevis transcription factor IIIA, the zinc finger name has now come to encompass a wide variety of differing protein structures.   Proteins that contain zinc fingers ( zinc finger proteins ) are classified into several different structural families. Unlike many other clearly defined supersecondary structures such as Greek keys or beta hairpins, there are a number of unique types of zinc fingers, each with a unique three-dimensional architecture. A particular zinc finger protein's class is determined by this three-dimensional structure, but it can also be recognized based on the primary structure of the protein or the identity of the ligands coordinating the zinc ion. In spite of the large variety of these proteins, however, the vast majority typically function as interaction modules that bind DNA, RNA, proteins, or other small, useful molecules, and variations in structure serve primarily to alter the binding specificity of a particular protein.  Since their original discovery and the elucidation of their structure, these interaction modules have proven ubiquitous in the biological world. In addition, zinc fingers have become extremely useful in various therapeutic and research capacities. Engineering zinc fingers to have an affinity for a specific sequence is an area of active research, and zinc finger nucleases and zinc finger transcription factors are two of the most important applications of this to be realized to date.","Zinc finger","Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc finger","NULL","NULL"

"71","NR","Nuclear hormone receptors","","10219237","In the field of molecular biology, nuclear receptors are a class of proteins found within cells that are responsible for sensing steroid and thyroid hormones and certain other molecules. In response, these receptors work with other proteins to regulate the expression of specific genes, thereby controlling the development, homeostasis, and metabolism of the organism.  Nuclear receptors have the ability to directly bind to DNA and regulate the expression of adjacent genes, hence these receptors are classified as transcription factors. The regulation of gene expression by nuclear receptors generally only happens when a ligand - a molecule that affects the receptor's behavior - is present. More specifically, ligand binding to a nuclear receptor results in a conformational change in the receptor, which, in turn, activates the receptor, resulting in up-regulation or down-regulation of gene expression.  A unique property of nuclear receptors that differentiates them from other classes of receptors is their ability to directly interact with and control the expression of genomic DNA. As a consequence, nuclear receptors play key roles in both embryonic development and adult homeostasis. As discussed below, nuclear receptors may be classified according to either mechanism or homology.","Nuclear receptor","Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear receptor","NULL","NULL"

Some members of this class of zinc fingers specifically bind the DNA sequence (A/T)GATA(A/G) in the regulatory regions of genes., giving rise to the name of the domain. In these domains, a single zinc ion is coordinated by 4 cysteine residues. NMR studies have shown the core of the Znf to comprise 2 irregular anti-parallel beta-sheets and an alpha-helix, followed by a long loop to the C-terminal end of the finger. The N-terminal part, which includes the helix, is similar in structure, but not sequence, to the N-terminal zinc module of the glucocorticoid receptor DNA-binding domain. The helix and the loop connecting the 2 beta-sheets interact with the major groove of the DNA, while the C-terminal tail wraps around into the minor groove. Interactions between the Znf and DNA are mainly hydrophobic, explaining the preponderance of thymines in the binding site; a large number of interactions with the phosphate backbone have also been observed. Two GATA zinc fingers are found in GATA-family transcription factors. However, there are several proteins that only contain a single copy of the domain.  It is also worth noting that many GATA-type Znfs (such as those found in the proteins GATAD2B and MTA1) have not been experimentally demonstrated to be DNA-binding domains. Furthermore, several GATA-type Znfs have been demonstrated to act as protein-recognition domains.

In group 2, there are TRPP ('P' for polycystic) and TRPML ('ML' for mucolipin). Many of these channels mediate a variety of sensations like the sensations of pain, hotness, warmth or coldness, different kinds of tastes, pressure, and vision. In the body, some TRP channels are thought to behave like microscopic thermometers and used in animals to sense hot or cold. Some TRP channels are activated by molecules found in spices like garlic ( allicin ), chilli pepper ( capsaicin ), wasabi ( allyl isothiocyanate ); others are activated by menthol, camphor, peppermint, and cooling agents; yet others are activated by molecules found in cannabis (i.e., THC, CBD and CBN ). Some act as sensors of osmotic pressure, volume, stretch, and vibration.  These ion channels are relatively non-selectively permeable to cations, including sodium, calcium and magnesium. TRP channels were initially discovered in trp -mutant strain of the fruit fly Drosophila. Later, TRP channels were found in vertebrates where they are ubiquitously expressed in many cell types and tissues. Most TRP channels are composed of 6 membrane -spanning helices with intracellular N- and C-termini.

The concentration of calcium (Ca 2+ ions) is normally several thousand times higher outside of the cell than inside. Activation of particular VDCCs allows Ca 2+ to rush into the cell, which, depending on the cell type, results in activation of calcium-sensitive potassium channels, muscular contraction, excitation of neurons, up-regulation of gene expression, or release of hormones or neurotransmitters.

Agonist binding to the extracellular domain evokes dimerization, and sometimes oligomerization, of RTKs (a small subset of RTKs forms multimers even in the absence of activating ligand). This leads to autophosphorylation in the tyrosine kinase domain in a trans orientation, serving as a site of assembly of protein complexes and stimulation of multiple signal transduction pathways, including phospholipase C-γ, mitogen-activated protein kinases and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.","Receptor tyrosine kinases","IUPHAR/BPS Guide to PHARMACOLOGY|http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/FamilyDisplayForward?familyId=304&familyType=CATALYTICRECEPTOR","NULL","STYK1"

It does this by carrying an amino acid to the protein synthetic machinery of a cell ( ribosome ) as directed by a three-nucleotide sequence ( codon ) in a messenger RNA (mRNA). As such, tRNAs are a necessary component of protein translation, the biological synthesis of new proteins according to the genetic code.  The specific nucleotide sequence of an mRNA specifies which amino acids are incorporated into the protein product of the gene from which the mRNA is transcribed, and the role of tRNA is to specify which sequence from the genetic code corresponds to which amino acid. One end of the tRNA matches the genetic code in a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon. The anticodon forms three base pairs with a codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis. The mRNA encodes a protein as a series of contiguous codons, each of which is recognized by a particular tRNA. On the other end of the tRNA is a covalent attachment to the amino acid that corresponds to the anticodon sequence. Each type of tRNA molecule can be attached to only one type of amino acid, so each organism has many types of tRNA (in fact, because the genetic code contains multiple codons that specify the same amino acid, there are many tRNA molecules bearing different anticodons which also carry the same amino acid).

However, it can be recruited and brought into action by the adaptive immune system.  The complement system consists of a number of small proteins found in the blood, in general synthesized by the liver, and normally circulating as inactive precursors (pro-proteins). When stimulated by one of several triggers, proteases in the system cleave specific proteins to release cytokines and initiate an amplifying cascade of further cleavages. The end-result of this activation cascade is massive amplification of the response and activation of the cell-killing membrane attack complex. Over 30 proteins and protein fragments make up the complement system, including serum proteins, serosal proteins, and cell membrane receptors.

In fact, yeast cells can proliferate normally when their CDK gene has been replaced with the homologous human gene. CDKs are relatively small proteins, with molecular weights ranging from 34 to 40 kDa, and contain little more than the kinase domain. By definition, a CDK binds a regulatory protein called a cyclin. Without cyclin, CDK has little kinase activity; only the cyclin-CDK complex is an active kinase. CDKs phosphorylate their substrates on serines and threonines, so they are serine-threonine kinases. The consensus sequence for the phosphorylation site in the amino acid sequence of a CDK substrate is PX, where S/T* is the phosphorylated serine or threonine, P is proline, X is any amino acid, K is lysine, and R is arginine","Cyclin-dependent kinase","Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin-dependent kinase","NULL","CDK1"

In the extracellular matrix, fibulin-1 associates with basement membranes and elastic fibers. The association with these matrix structures is mediated by its ability to interact with numerous extracellular matrix constituents including fibronectin, proteoglycans, laminins and tropoelastin. In blood, fibulin-1 binds to fibrinogen and incorporates into clots.  Fibulins are secreted glycoproteins that become incorporated into a fibrillar extracellular matrix when expressed by cultured cells or added exogenously to cell monolayers. The five known members of the family share an elongated structure and many calcium-binding sites, owing to the presence of tandem arrays of epidermal growth factor-like domains. They have overlapping binding sites for several basement-membrane proteins, tropoelastin, fibrillin, fibronectin and proteoglycans, and they participate in diverse supramolecular structures. The amino-terminal domain I of fibulin consists of three anaphylatoxin -like (AT) modules, each approximately 40 residues long and containing four or six cysteines. The structure of an AT module was determined for the complement-derived anaphylatoxin C3a, and was found to be a compact alpha-helical fold that is stabilized by three disulphide bridges in the pattern Cys14, Cys25 and Cys36 (where Cys is cysteine).

The GUK domain that they have is structurally very similar to that of the guanylate kinases, however it is known to be catalytically inactive as the P-Loop which binds ATP is absent. It is thought that the MAGUKs have subfunctionalized the GUK domain for their own purposes, primarily based on its ability to form protein-protein interactions with cytoskeleton proteins, microtubule / actin based machinery and molecules involved in signal transduction.  The PDZ domain which are contained in the MAGUKs in varying numbers. PDZ domains are short peptide binding sequences commonly found at the C-terminus of interacting proteins. Copies within each of the family members often have different binding partners, due to amino acid differences between the copies. The SH3 domain is again a protein-protein interaction domain. Its family generally bind to PXXP sites, but in MAGUKs it is known to bind to other sites as well. One of the most well known features is that it can form an intramolecular bond with the GUK domain, creating what is known as a GUK-SH3 'closed' state.","Membrane-associated guanylate kinase","Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane-associated guanylate kinase","NULL","CASK"

Sirtuins regulate important biological pathways in bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. The name Sir2 comes from the yeast gene 'silent mating-type information regulation 2 ', the gene responsible for cellular regulation in yeast. The term sirtuins is derived from the word 'sir-two-ins'. Sirtuins have been implicated in influencing a wide range of cellular processes like aging, transcription, apoptosis, inflammation and stress resistance, as well as energy efficiency and alertness during low-calorie situations. Sirtuins can also control circadian clocks and mitochondrial biogenesis.  Yeast Sir2 and some, but not all, sirtuins are protein deacetylases. Unlike other known protein deacetylases, which simply hydrolyze acetyl - lysine residues, the sirtuin-mediated deacetylation reaction couples lysine deacetylation to NAD hydrolysis. This hydrolysis yields O-acetyl-ADP- ribose, the deacetylated substrate and nicotinamide, itself an inhibitor of sirtuin activity.

The subunits of this complex are encoded by the ORC1, ORC2, ORC3, ORC4, ORC5 and ORC6 genes. ORC is a central component for eukaryotic DNA replication, and binds chromatin at replication origins throughout the cell cycle. ORC directs DNA replication throughout the genome and is required for its initiation. ORC bound at replication origins serves as the foundation for assembly of the pre-replication complex (pre-RC), which includes Cdc6, Tah11 (aka Cdt1), and the Mcm2 - Mcm7 complex. Pre-RC assembly during G1 is required for replication licensing of chromosomes prior to DNA synthesis during S phase. Cell cycle -regulated phosphorylation of Orc2, Orc6, Cdc6, and MCM by the cyclin -dependent protein kinase Cdc28 regulates initiation of DNA replication, including blocking reinitiation in G2 / M phase.   In yeast, ORC also plays a role in the establishment of silencing at the mating-type loci Hidden MAT Left (HML) and Hidden MAT Right (HMR). ORC participates in the assembly of transcriptionally silent chromatin at HML and HMR by recruiting the Sir1 silencing protein to the HML and HMR silencers. Both Orc1 and Orc5 bind ATP, though only Orc1 has ATPase activity. The binding of ATP by Orc1 is required for ORC binding to DNA and is essential for cell viability. The ATPase activity of Orc1 is involved in formation of the pre-RC. ATP binding by Orc5 is crucial for the stability of ORC as a whole. Only the Orc1-5 subunits are required for origin binding; Orc6 is essential for maintenance of pre-RCs once formed.

"974","ACAD","Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family","","19639238","Acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (ACADs) are a class of enzymes that function to catalyze the initial step in each cycle of fatty acid Î²-oxidation in the mitochondria of cells. Their action results in the introduction of a trans double-bond between C2 (Î±) and C3 (Î²) of the acyl-CoA thioester substrate. Flavin adenine dinucleotide ( FAD ) is a required co-factor in addition to the presence of an active site glutamate in order for the enzyme to function.  ACADs can be categorized into three distinct groups based on their specificity for short-, medium-, or long-chain fatty acid acyl-CoA substrates. While different dehydrogenases target fatty acids of varying chain length, all types of ACADs are mechanistically similar. Differences in the enzyme occur based on the location of the active site along the amino acid sequence.   ACADs are an important class of enzymes in mammalian cells because of their role in metabolizing fatty acids present in ingested food materials. This enzyme's action represents the first step in fatty acid metabolism (the process of breaking long chains of fatty acids into acetyl CoA molecules). Deficiencies in these enzymes are linked to genetic disorders involving fatty acid oxidation (i.e. metabolic disorders).   ACAD enzymes have been identified in animals (of which there are 9 major eukaryotic classes), as well as plants, nematodes, fungi, and bacteria. Five of these nine classes are involved in fatty acid Î²-oxidation (SCAD, MCAD, LCAD, VLCAD, and VLCAD2), and the other four are involved in branched chain amino acid metabolism (i3VD, i2VD, GD, and iBD). Most acyl-CoA dehydrogenases are Î± 4 homotetramers, and in two cases (for very long chain fatty acid substrates) they are Î± 2 homodimers. An additional class of acyl-CoA dehydrogenase was discovered that catalyzes Î±,Î²-unsaturation reactions with steroid-CoA thioesters in certain types of bacteria. This class of ACAD was demonstrated to form Î± 2 Î² 2 heterotetramers, rather than the usual Î± 4 homotetramer, a protein architecture that evolved in order to accommodate a much larger steroid-CoA substrate.

Base excision repair is the mechanism by which damaged bases in DNA are removed and replaced. DNA glycosylases catalyze the first step of this process. They remove the damaged nitrogenous base while leaving the sugar-phosphate backbone intact, creating an apurinic/apyrimidinic site, commonly referred to as an AP site. This is accomplished by flipping the damaged base out of the double helix followed by cleavage of the N- glycosidic bond.   Glycosylases were first discovered in bacteria, and have since been found in all kingdoms of life. In addition to their role in base excision repair DNA glycosylase enzymes have been implicated in the repression of gene silencing in A. thaliana, N. tabacum and other plants by active demethylation. 5-methylcytosine residues are excised and replaced with unmethylated cytosines allowing access to the chromatin structure of the enzymes and proteins necessary for transcription and subsequent translation.","DNA glycosylase","Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA glycosylase","NULL","NULL"

"1026","MSH","MutS homologs","","10606644","Mismatch repair contributes to the overall fidelity of DNA replication and is essential for combating the adverse effects of damage to the genome. It involves the correction of mismatched base pairs that have been missed by the proofreading element ( Klenow fragment ) of the DNA polymerase complex. The post-replicative Mismatch Repair System (MMRS) of Escherichia coli involves MutS (Mutator S), MutL and MutH proteins, and acts to correct point mutations or small insertion/deletion loops produced during DNA replication. MutS and MutL are involved in preventing recombination between partially homologous DNA sequences. The assembly of MMRS is initiated by MutS, which recognizes and binds to mispaired nucleotides and allows further action of MutL and MutH to eliminate a portion of newly synthesized DNA strand containing the mispaired base. MutS can also collaborate with methyltransferases in the repair of O(6)-methylguanine damage, which would otherwise pair with thymine during replication to create an O(6)mG:T mismatch. MutS exists as a dimer, where the two monomers have different conformations and form a heterodimer at the structural level. Only one monomer recognises the mismatch specifically and has ADP bound. Non-specific major groove DNA-binding domains from both monomers embrace the DNA in a clamp-like structure. Mismatch binding induces ATP uptake and a conformational change in the MutS protein, resulting in a clamp that translocates on DNA.  MutS is a modular protein with a complex structure, and is composed of:  N-terminal mismatch-recognition domain, which is similar in structure to tRNA endonuclease.  Connector domain, which is similar in structure to Holliday junction resolvase ruvC.  Core domain, which is composed of two separate subdomains that join together to form a helical bundle; from within the core domain, two helices act as levers that extend towards (but do not touch) the DNA.  Clamp domain, which is inserted between the two subdomains of the core domain at the top of the lever helices; the clamp domain has a beta-sheet structure.  ATPase domain (connected to the core domain), which has a classical Walker A motif.  HTH (helix-turn-helix) domain, which is involved in dimer contacts.   Homologues of MutS have been found in many species including eukaryotes (MSH 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 proteins), archaea and bacteria, and together these proteins have been grouped into the MutS family. Although many of these proteins have similar activities to the E. coli MutS, there is significant diversity of function among the MutS family members. This diversity is even seen within species, where many species encode multiple MutS homologues with distinct functions. Inter-species homologues may have arisen through frequent ancient horizontal gene transfer of MutS (and MutL) from bacteria to archaea and eukaryotes via endosymbiotic ancestors of mitochondria and chloroplasts.   .","MutS","Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MutS-1","NULL","MSH2"

They combine with RING proteins to form Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) that are highly diverse and play a role in myriad cellular processes.   The human genome contains eight cullin genes  CUL1, part of SCF complex  CUL2, part of ECS complex ( Elongin C - CUL2 - SOCS-box )  CUL3, part of CUL3-BTB complex  CUL4A  CUL4B  CUL5  CUL7  CUL9, also known as PARC  There is also a more distant member called ANAPC2 (or APC2), part of the Anaphase-promoting complex.  CUL1, 2, 3, 4A, 4B, 5 and 7 each form part of a multi-subunit ubiquitin complex.  Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs), such as Cul1 (SCF) play an essential role in targeting proteins for ubiquitin-mediated destruction; as such, they are diverse in terms of composition and function, regulating many different processes from glucose sensing and DNA replication to limb patterning and circadian rhythms. The catalytic core of CRLs consists of a RING protein and a cullin family member. For Cul1, the C-terminal cullin-homology domain binds the RING protein. The RING protein appears to function as a docking site for ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s). Other proteins contain a cullin-homology domain, such as CUL9, also known as p53 cytoplasmic anchor PARC, and the ANAPC2 subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome; both CUL9 and ANAPC2 have ubiquitin ligase activity. The N-terminal region of cullins is more variable, and is used to interact with specific adaptor proteins.   With the exception of ANAPC2, each member of the cullin family is modified by Nedd8 and several cullins function in Ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis, a process in which the 26S proteasome recognises and subsequently degrades a target protein tagged with K48-linked poly-ubiquitin chains.

Consequently, the enzyme plays a key role in the metabolism of nucleotides.  The enzyme has a wide substrate specificity for nucleotides and has been shown to hydrolyze 5'nucleotides rapidly, ribose-5-phosphate slowly, and other phosphate esters extremely slowly (if at all).

The winding problem of DNA arises due to the intertwined nature of its double-helical structure. During DNA replication and transcription, DNA becomes overwound ahead of a replication fork. If left unabated, this tension would eventually stop the ability of the enzymes involved in these processes to continue down the DNA strand.  In order to prevent and correct these types of topological problems caused by the double helix, topoisomerases bind to either single-stranded or double-stranded DNA and cut the phosphate backbone of the DNA. This intermediate break allows the DNA to be untangled or unwound, and, at the end of these processes, the DNA backbone is resealed again. Since the overall chemical composition and connectivity of the DNA do not change, the tangled and untangled DNAs are chemical isomers, differing only in their global topology, thus their name. Topoisomerases are isomerase enzymes that act on the topology of DNA.

Together with a number of accessory proteins, these ESCRT complexes enable a unique mode of membrane remodeling that results in membranes bending/budding away from the cytoplasm. These ESCRT components have been isolated and studied in a number of organisms including yeast and humans.   The ESCRT machinery plays a vital role in a number of cellular processes including multivesicular body (MVB) biogenesis, cellular abscission, and viral budding. Multivesicular body (MVB) biogenesis is a process in which ubiquitin tagged proteins enter organelles called endosomes via the formation of vesicles. This process is essential for cells to destroy misfolded and damaged proteins. Without ESCRT machinery, these proteins can build up and lead to neurodegenerative disease. For example, abnormalities in ESCRT-III components can lead to neurological disorders such as hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). Cellular abscission, the process by which the membrane connecting two daughter cells is cleaved, is also mediated by ESCRT machinery. Without the ESCRT complexes, daughter cells could not separate and abnormal cells containing twice the amount of DNA would be generated. These cells would inevitably be destroyed through a process known as apoptosis. Lastly, viral budding, or the process by which specific types of viruses exit cells, may not occur in the absence of ESCRT machinery. This would inevitably prevent viruses from spreading from cell to cell.","ESCRT","Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESCRT","NULL","NULL"

The protein is named spectrin since it was first isolated as a major protein component of human red blood cells which had been treated with mild detergents; the detergents lysed the cells and the hemoglobin and other cytoplasmic components were washed out. In the light microscope the basic shape of the red blood cell could still be seen as the spectrin containing submembranous cytoskeleton preserved the shape of the cell in outline. This became known as a red blood cell 'ghost', and so the major protein of the ghost was named spectrin. Spectrin forms pentagonal or hexagonal arrangements, forming a scaffolding and playing an important role in maintenance of plasma membrane integrity and cytoskeletal structure. The hexagonal arrangements are formed by tetramers of spectrin subunits associating with short actin filaments at either end of the tetramer. These short actin filaments act as junctional complexes allowing the formation of the hexagonal mesh.  In certain types of brain injury such as diffuse axonal injury, spectrin is irreversibly cleaved by the proteolytic enzyme calpain, destroying the cytoskeleton. Spectrin cleavage causes the membrane to form blebs and ultimately to be degraded, usually leading to the death of the cell. Spectrin subunits may also be cleaved by caspase family enzymes, and calpain and caspase produce different spectrin breakdown products which can be detected by western blotting with appropriate antibodies. Calpain cleavage may indicate activation of necrosis, while caspase cleavage may indicate apoptosis.","Spectrin","Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrin","NULL","SPTBN1"

Multiple basal cell carcinomas (basaliomas) and other skin malignancies frequently occur at a young age in those with XP; metastatic malignant melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma are the two most common causes of death in XP victims. This disease involves both sexes and all races, with an incidence of 1:250,000 in the United States. XP is roughly six times more common in Japanese people than in other groups.  Normally, damage to DNA in epidermal cells occurs during exposure to UV light. The absorption of the high-energy light leads to the formation of pyrimidine dimers, namely cyclobutane-pyrimidine dimers and pyrimidine-6-4-pyrimidone photoproducts. In a healthy, normal human being, the damage is first excised by endonucleases. DNA polymerase then repairs the missing sequence, and ligase 'seals' the transaction.

It has important roles in the ubiquitination of proteins involved in the cell cycle and also marks various other cellular proteins for destruction.   Core Components  SCF contains three core subunits, and a number of less critical components:   F-box protein ( e.g. Cdc4 ) â€' Contributes to the specificity of SCF by aggregating to target proteins independently of the complex and then binding to the Skp1 component, thus allowing the protein to be brought into proximity with the functional E2 protein. The F-box is also essential in regulating SCF activity during the course of the cell-cycle. SCF levels are thought to remain constant throughout the cell-cycle. Instead, F-box affinity for protein substrates is regulated through cdk/cyclin mediated phosphorylation of target proteins.   Skp1 â€' Skp1 is a bridging protein and forms part of the horseshoe-shaped complex in tandem with cullin (cul1). Skp1 is essential in the recognition and binding of the F-box.   Cullin ( CUL1 ) â€' CUL1 forms the major structural scaffold of the SCF complex and links the skp1 domain with the Rbx1 domain.   RBX1 â€' Rbx1 contains a small zinc-binding domain called the RING Finger, to which the E2-ubiquitin conjugate binds, allowing the transferral of the ubiquitin to a lysine residue on the target protein.   SCF and Cell Cycle Regulation  Progression through the cell cycle in eukaryotes is regulated through synthesisdephosphorylation of cell-cycle-regulating proteins. Two ubiquitin ligases are crucial in the cell cycle. The anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome ( APC/C ) controls the metaphase â€' anaphase transition when bound to its substrate-specific activating subunit Cdc20 : this complex ubiquitinylates the separase -inhibiting protein securin, paving the way for separase to break cohesin and thus separate the sister chromatids at the centromere. APC/C with another activating subunit, Cdh1, is active in G1 phase and controls levels of the mitosis-regulating B-type cyclins.  SCF controls the transitions between G1/S and G2/M phases. Two F-box-protein-bound SCF complexes (SCF- Skp2 and SCF- Î²-TrCP ), are most well studied among over 70 F-box proteins identified in humans. SCF-Skp2 mainly ubiquitinates and degrades cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) such as p27 and p21 as well as the G1-/S-specific cyclin E, in vivo and in vitro. Therefore, SCF-Skp2 promotes cell-cycle progression and cell growth. On the other hand, SCF-Î²TrCP promotes proteolysis of Emi1, an APC/C-Cdh1 inhibitor, and Wee1, a Cdk1 inhibitor, in early mitosis via phosphorylation at their degron (the amino acid motif DSGXXS, where X can be any amino acid) by kinases such as Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) and Cdk1â€'cyclin B. SCF-Î²TrCP and APC/C control each other to regulate timely progression through the cell cycle. Lists of substrates of SCF-Skp2 and -Î²TrCP are still growing.  SCF and Plant Hormone Signaling  In plants, the plant hormone auxin stimulates binding of SCF-TIR1 to the AUX/IAA repressor and then the degradation of the repressor, resulting in the activation of auxin-responsive genes. The TIR1 F-box protein acts as an auxin receptor and directly links reception of auxin to degradation of the Aux/IAA proteins. TIR1 (Transport Inhibitor Response 1) belongs to AFBs (Auxin Signaling F-box proteins).   In plants, the plant hormone Jasmonate allows binding between SCF-COI1 to the JAZ transcription factor. Degradation of the JAZ transcription factor allows for the transcription of the jasmonate responsive genes.","SCF complex","Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCF complex","NULL","NULL"

In non-stimulated cells, DGK activity is low allowing DAG to be used for glycerophospholipid biosynthesis but on receptor activation of the phosphoinositide pathway, DGK activity increases driving the conversion of DAG to PA. As both lipids are thought to function as bioactive lipid signaling molecules with distinct cellular targets, DGK therefore occupies an important position, effectively serving as a switch by terminating the signalling of one lipid while simultaneously activating signalling by another.   In bacteria, DGK is very small (13 to 15 kD) membrane protein which seems to contain three transmembrane domains. The best conserved region is a stretch of 12 residues which are located in a cytoplasmic loop between the second and third transmembrane domains. Some Gram-positive bacteria also encode a soluble diacylglycerol kinase capable of reintroducing DAG into the phospholipid biosynthesis pathway. DAG accumulates in Gram-positive bacteria as a result of the transfer of glycerol-1-phosphate moieties from phosphatidylglycerol to lipotechoic acid.","Diacylglycerol kinase","Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacylglycerol kinase","NULL","DGKA"

They are named after their initial discovery in the proteins L in11, I sl-1 & M ec-3. LIM-domain containing proteins have been shown to play roles in cytoskeletal organisation, organ development and oncogenesis. LIM-domains mediate protein:protein interactions that are critical to cellular processes.  LIM domains have highly divergent sequences, apart from certain key residues. The sequence divergence allow a great many different binding sites to be grafted onto the same basic domain. The conserved residues are those involved in zinc binding or the hydrophobic core of the protein. The sequence signature of LIM domains is as follows:  - 2-4 -- 13-19 --- 2-4 ----- 2-4 -- 13-20 -C- 2-4 -       LIM domain organisation  LIM domains frequently occur in multiples, as seen in proteins such as TES, LMO4, and can also be attached to other domains in order to confer a binding or targeting function upon them, such as LIM-kinase.  The LIM superclass of genes have been classified into 14 classes: ABLIM, CRP, ENIGMA, EPLIN, LASP, LHX, LMO, LIMK, LMO7, MICAL, PXN, PINCH, TES, and ZYX. Six of these classes (i.e., ABLIM, MICAL, ENIGMA, ZYX, LHX, LM07) originated in the stem lineage of animals, and this expansion is thought to have made a major contribution to the origin of animal multicellularity.   LIM domains are also found in various bacterial lineages where they are typically fused to a metallopeptidase domain. Some versions show fusions to an inactive P-loop NTPase at their N-terminus and a single transmembrane helix. These domain fusions suggest that the prokaryotic LIM domains are likely to regulate protein processing at the cell membrane. The domain architectural syntax is remarkable parallel to those of the prokaryotic versions of the B-box zinc finger and the AN1 zinc finger domains.","LIM domain","Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIM domain","NULL","NULL"

PDZ is an acronym combining the first letters of three proteins â€' post synaptic density protein (PSD95), Drosophila disc large tumor suppressor (Dlg1), and zonula occludens-1 protein (zo-1) â€' which were first discovered to share the domain. PDZ domains have previously been referred to as DHR (Dlg homologous region) or GLGF ( glycine - leucine -glycine- phenylalanine ) domains. Proteins with these domains help hold together and organize signaling complexes at cellular membranes. Protein domains, connected by intrinsically disordered flexible linker regions, induce long-range allostery via protein domain dynamics. PDZ domains also play a highly significant role in the anchoring of cell surface receptors (such as CFTR and FZD7 ) to the actin cytoskeleton via mediators like NHERF and ezrin.   In general PDZ domains bind to a short region of the C-terminus of other specific proteins. These short regions bind to the PDZ domain by beta sheet augmentation. This means that the beta sheet in the PDZ domain is extended by the addition of a further beta strand from the tail of the binding partner protein.","PDZ domain","Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDZ domain","NULL","PDZD3"

Specifically, they are thought to be involved in regulating the number of synaptic vesicles available for release via exocytosis at any one time. Synapsins are present in invertebrates and vertebrates and are somewhat homologous across evaluated vertebrates.  Current studies suggest the following hypothesis for the role of synapsin: synapsins bind synaptic vesicles to components of the cytoskeleton which prevents them from migrating to the presynaptic membrane and releasing neurotransmitter. During an action potential, synapsins are phosphorylated by PKA (cAMP dependent protein kinase), releasing the synaptic vesicles and allowing them to move to the membrane and release their neurotransmitter.  Gene knockout studies in mice (where the mouse is unable to produce synapsin) have had some surprising results. Mice lacking all three synapsins are prone to seizures, and experience learning defects. These results suggest that while synapsins are not essential for synaptic function, they do serve an important modulatory role. Conversely, studies using transgenic mice in which neuronal signaling is abolished in specific circuitries showed that synaptic activity regulates, but is not essential to maintain, the expression of these proteins.","Synapsin","Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapsin","NULL","SYN1"

"1341","","Apoptosome","","","The apoptosome is a large quaternary protein structure formed in the process of apoptosis. Its formation is triggered by the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria in response to an internal (intrinsic) or external (extrinsic) cell death stimulus. Stimuli can vary from DNA damage and viral infection to developmental cues such as those leading to the degradation of a tadpole's tail.  In mammalian cells, once cytochrome c is released, it binds to the cytosolic protein Apaf-1 to facilitate the formation of apoptosome. An early biochemical study suggests a two-to-one ratio of cytochrome c to apaf-1 for apoptosome formation. However, recent structural studies suggest the cytochrome c to apaf-1 ratio is one-to-one. It has also been shown that the nucleotide dATP as third component binds to apaf-1, however its exact role is still debated. The mammalian apoptosome had never been crystallized, but a human APAF-1/cytochrome-c apoptosome has been imaged at lower (2 nm ) resolution by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy 10 years ago, revealing a wheel-like particle with 7-fold symmetry. Recently, a medium resolution (9.5 Ã…ngstrÃ¶m) structure of human apoptosome was also solved by cryo-electron microscopy, which allows unambiguous inference for positions of all the APAF-1 domains (CARD, NBARC and WD40) and cytochrome c. There is also now a crystal structure of the monomeric, inactive Apaf-1 subunit (PDB 3SFZ).    Once formed, the apoptosome can then recruit and activate the inactive pro-caspase-9. Once activated, this initiator caspase can then activate effector caspases and trigger a cascade of events leading to apoptosis.","Apoptosome","Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosome","NULL","NULL"
"1342","","Death inducing signaling complex","","","The death-inducing signaling complex or DISC is a multi-protein complex formed by members of the 'death receptor' family of apoptosis -inducing cellular receptors. A typical example is FasR, which forms the DISC upon trimerization as a result of its ligand ( FasL ) binding. The DISC is composed of the death receptor, FADD, and caspase 8. It transduces a downstream signal cascade resulting in apoptosis.  The Fas ligands, or cytotoxicity-dependent APO-1-associated proteins, physically associate with APO-1 (also known as the Fas receptor, or CD95), a tumor necrosis factor containing a functional death domain. This association leads to the formation of the DISC, thereby inducing apoptosis. The entire process is initiated when the cell registers the presence of CD95L, the cognate ligand for APO-1. Upon binding, the CAP proteins and procaspase-8 (composed of FLICE, MACH, and Mch5) bind to CD95 through death domain and death effector domain interactions. Procaspase-8 activation is thought to occur through a dimerization process with other procaspase-8 molecules, known as an induced proximity model.  The CAP proteins associate only with the oligomerized version of APO-1 when forming the complex. The CAP1 are CAP2 proteins are also known as FADD/MORT1, an adaptor molecule with a death domain. CAP4 is also called FLICE, a cysteine protease with two death effector domains. CAP3 is the prodomain of FLICE generated during proteolytic activation. Once the DISC assembles, it allows APO-1 signaling to occur, which triggers cell death. In order to do this, downstream targets such as FLICE must be activated. In its inactive state, FLICE's two death domains are thought to bind together and prevent its activation. Once APO-1 aggregates within the cytosol, it recruits FADD, CAP3, and FLICE to the receptor, where FLICE is modified into several active subunits, which have the ability to cleave a variety of substrates. This proteolytic activity then results in a cascade of caspase activation, and ultimately cell death. This apoptotic activity is critical for tissue homeostasis and immune function.  APO-1-mediated apoptosis can be inhibited by a variety of factors, including the viral caspase inhibitors CrmA and p35, as well as viral FLICE-inhibitory proteins known as v-FLIPs. When in the presence of APO-1, v-FLIPs preferentially bind and prevent procaspase-8 from being recruited; as such, apoptosis is stalled. Interestingly, humans have a homolog for v-FLIP known as c-FLIP, which occurs in two endogenous forms (c-FLIPL (long) and c-FLIPS (short)). These are similar in structure to procaspase-8, but lack the amino acids necessary for caspase-8 catalytic activity. It is thought that c-FLIP may be involved in modulating the immune system, as c-FLIPS is upregulated upon stimulation of the T cell receptor. Furthermore, as high expression of FLIP is known to promote tumor growth, these inhibitor molecules play a role in cancer proliferation.  The DISC has been implicated as a possible drug development target for various cancers, including leukemia, glioma, and colon cancer. In glioma cells, the effects of TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) have been shown to induce DISC-mediated apoptosis. Specifically, TRAIL works by activating two death receptors, DR4 and DR5; these bind to FADD, which then interacts with caspase-8 to assemble the DISC. Tumor cells show varying sensitivity to TRAIL modulated apoptosis, depending on the presence of the antiapoptotic FLIP proteins.

Plasma ferritin is also an indirect marker of the total amount of iron stored in the body, hence serum ferritin is used as a diagnostic test for iron-deficiency anemia.   Ferritin is a globular protein complex consisting of 24 protein subunits forming a nanocage with multiple metalâ€'protein interactions.

The GST family consists of three superfamilies: the cytosolic, mitochondrial, and microsomal — also known as MAPEG — proteins. Members of the GST superfamily are extremely diverse in amino acid sequence, and a large fraction of the sequences deposited in public databases are of unknown function. The Enzyme Function Initiative (EFI) is using GSTs as a model superfamily to identify new GST functions.  GSTs can constitute up to 10% of cytosolic protein in some mammalian organs. GSTs catalyse the conjugation of GSH — via a sulfhydryl group — to electrophilic centers on a wide variety of substrates in order to make the compounds more water-soluble. This activity detoxifies endogenous compounds such as peroxidised lipids and enables the breakdown of xenobiotics. GSTs may also bind toxins and function as transport proteins, which gave rise to the early term for GSTs, ligandin.","Glutathione S-transferase","Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione S-transferase","NULL","NULL"

This traffic is bidirectional, to ensure that proteins required to form vesicles are recycled. Vesicles have specific coat proteins (such as clathrin or coatomer) that are important for cargo selection and direction of transfer [PMID: 15261670].  Clathrin coats contain both clathrin and adaptor complexes that link clathrin to receptors in coated vesicles. Clathrin-associated protein complexes are believed to interact with the cytoplasmic tails of membrane proteins, leading to their selection and concentration. The two major types of clathrin adaptor complexes are the heterotetrameric adaptor protein (AP) complexes, and the monomeric GGA (Golgi-localising, Gamma-adaptin ear domain homology, ARF-binding proteins) adaptors [PMID: 17449236]. All AP complexes are heterotetramers composed of two large subunits (adaptins), a medium subunit (mu) and a small subunit (sigma). Each subunit has a specific function. Adaptin subunits recognise and bind to clathrin through their hinge region (clathrin box), and recruit accessory proteins that modulate AP function through their C-terminal appendage domains. By contrast, GGAs are monomers composed of four domains, which have functions similar to AP subunits: an N-terminal VHS (Vps27p/Hrs/Stam) domain, a GAT (GGA and Tom1) domain, a hinge region, and a C-terminal GAE (gamma-adaptin ear) domain. The GAE domain is similar to the AP gamma-adaptin ear domain, being responsible for the recruitment of accessory proteins that regulate clathrin-mediated endocytosis [PMID: 12858162].  While clathrin mediates endocytic protein transport from ER to Golgi, coatomers (COPI, COPII) primarily mediate intra-Golgi transport, as well as the reverse Golgi to ER transport of dilysine-tagged proteins [PMID: 14690497]. Coatomers reversibly associate with Golgi (non-clathrin-coated) vesicles to mediate protein transport and for budding from Golgi membranes [PMID: 17041781]. Coatomer complexes are hetero-oligomers composed of at least an alpha, beta, beta', gamma, delta, epsilon and zeta subunits.  This entry represents the N-terminal domain of various adaptins from different AP clathrin adaptor complexes (including AP1, AP2, AP3 and AP4), and from the beta and gamma subunits of various coatomer (COP) adaptors. This domain has a 2-layer alpha/alpha fold that forms a right-handed superhelix, and is a member of the ARM repeat superfamily [PMID: 12086608]. The N-terminal region of the various AP adaptor proteins share strong sequence identity; by contrast, the C-terminal domains of different adaptins share similar structural folds, but have little sequence identity [PMID: 2495531]. It has been proposed that the N-terminal domain interacts with another uniform component of the coated vesicles.","2495531,15261670,17041781,12086608","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL"

Pumilio family members are characterised by the presence of eight tandem copies of an imperfectly repeated 36 amino acids sequence motif, the Pumilio repeat, surrounded by a short N- and C-terminal conserved region. The eight repeats and the N- and C-terminal regions form the Pumilio homology domain (PUM-HD). The PUM-HD domain is a sequence-specific RNA binding domain. Several Puf members have been shown to bind specific RNA sequences mainly found in the 3' UTR of mRNA and repress their translation [PMID: 14584586]. Frequently, Puf proteins function asymmetrically to create protein gradients, thus causing asymmetric cell division and regulating cell fate specification [PMID: 1459455].  Crystal structure of Pumilio repeats has been solved [PMID: 11336708]. The PUM repeat with the N- and C-terminal regions pack together to form a right-handed superhelix that approximates a half doughnut structurally similar to the Armadillo (ARM) repeat proteins, beta-catenin and karyopherin alpha. The RNA binds the concave surface of the molecule, where each of the protein's eight repeats makes contacts with a different RNA base via three amino acid side chains at conserved positions [PMID: 12202039].

[PMID:29100073]","29100073","Neurexin (NRXN) is a presynaptic protein that helps to connect neurons at the synapse. They are located mostly on the presynaptic membrane and contain a single transmembrane domain. The extracellular domain interacts with proteins in the synaptic cleft, most notably neuroligin, while the intracellular cytoplasmic portion interacts with proteins associated with exocytosis. Neurexin and neuroligin 'shake hands,' resulting in the connection between the two neurons and the production of a synapse. Neurexins mediate signaling across the synapse, and influence the properties of neural networks by synapse specificity. Neurexins were discovered as receptors for α-latrotoxin, a vertebrate-specific toxin in black widow spider venom that binds to presynaptic receptors and induces massive neurotransmitter release. In humans, alterations in genes encoding neurexins are implicated in autism and other cognitive diseases, such as Tourette syndrome and schizophrenia.

Neuroligins also affect the properties of neural networks by specifying synaptic functions, and they mediate signalling by recruiting and stabilizing key synaptic components. Neuroligins interact with other postsynaptic proteins to localize neurotransmitter receptors and channels in the postsynaptic density as the cell matures. Additionally, neuroligins are expressed in human peripheral tissues and have been found to play a role in angiogenesis.

This is how clathrin gets its name, from the Latin clathratus meaning like a lattice. Coat-proteins, like clathrin, are used to build small vesicles in order to transport molecules within cells. The endocytosis and exocytosis of vesicles allows cells to communicate, to transfer nutrients, to import signaling receptors, to mediate an immune response after sampling the extracellular world, and to clean up the cell debris left by tissue inflammation. The endocytic pathway can be hijacked by viruses and other pathogens in order to gain entry to the cell during infection.","Clathrin","Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clathrin","NULL","NULL"

This restructuring of the actin cytoskeleton is essential for processes such as organ development, wound healing, and the hunting down of infectious intruders by cells of the immune system.  Profilin also binds sequences rich in the amino acid proline in diverse proteins. While most profilin in the cell is bound to actin, profilins have over 50 different binding partners. Many of those are related to actin regulation, but profilin also seems to be involved in activities in the nucleus such as mRNA splicing.Profilin binds some variants of membrane phospholipids (phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate and inositol trisphosphate). The function of this interaction is the sequestration of profilin in an 'inactive' form, from where it can be released by action of the enzyme phospholipase C.  Profilin is the major allergen present in birch, grass, and other pollen and is found in Toxoplasma gondii as an essential part of host cell invasion.

This is a two-step process, which involves oxidation of isocitrate (a secondary alcohol) to oxalosuccinate (a ketone), followed by the decarboxylation of the carboxyl group beta to the ketone, forming alpha-ketoglutarate. In humans, IDH exists in three isoforms: IDH3 catalyzes the third step of the citric acid cycle while converting NAD+ to NADH in the mitochondria. The isoforms IDH1 and IDH2 catalyze the same reaction outside the context of the citric acid cycle and use NADP+ as a cofactor instead of NAD+.

It is produced in the stomach and is one of the main digestive enzymes in the digestive systems of humans and many other animals, where it helps digest the proteins in food. Pepsin is an aspartic protease, using a catalytic aspartate in its active site.It is one of three principal proteases in the human digestive system, the other two being chymotrypsin and trypsin. During the process of digestion, these enzymes, each of which is specialized in severing links between particular types of amino acids, collaborate to break down dietary proteins into their components, i.e., peptides and amino acids, which can be readily absorbed by the small intestine. Pepsin is most efficient in cleaving peptide bonds between hydrophobic and preferably aromatic amino acids such as phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine. Pepsin's proenzyme, pepsinogen, is released by the chief cells in the stomach wall, and upon mixing with the hydrochloric acid of the gastric juice, pepsinogen activates to become pepsin.

"1928","","Peptidase family A1","","","Aspartic proteases are a catalytic type of protease enzymes that use an activated water molecule bound to one or more aspartate residues for catalysis of their peptide substrates. In general, they have two highly conserved aspartates in the active site and are optimally active at acidic pH. Nearly all known aspartyl proteases are inhibited by pepstatin.Aspartic endopeptidases EC 3.4.23. of vertebrate, fungal and retroviral origin have been characterised. More recently, aspartic endopeptidases associated with the processing of bacterial type 4 prepilin and archaean preflagellin have been described.Eukaryotic aspartic proteases include pepsins, cathepsins, and renins. They have a two-domain structure, arising from ancestral duplication. Retroviral and retrotransposon proteases (retroviral aspartyl proteases) are much smaller and appear to  be homologous to a single domain of the eukaryotic aspartyl proteases. Each domain contributes a catalytic Asp residue, with an extended active site cleft localized between the two lobes of the molecule. One lobe has probably evolved from the other through a gene duplication event in the distant past. In modern-day enzymes, although the three-dimensional structures are very similar, the amino acid sequences are more divergent, except for the catalytic site motif, which is very conserved. The presence and position of disulfide bridges are other conserved features of aspartic peptidases.","Aspartic protease","Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartic protease","NULL","NULL"

The presence of the proteins bound to a pre-mRNA molecule serves as a signal that the pre-mRNA is not yet fully processed and therefore not ready for export to the cytoplasm. Since most mature RNA is exported from the nucleus relatively quickly, most RNA-binding protein in the nucleus exist as heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein particles. After splicing has occurred, the proteins remain bound to spliced introns and target them for degradation.  hnRNPs are also integral to the 40s subunit of the ribosome and therefore important for the translation of mRNA in the cytoplasm. However, hnRNPs also have their own nuclear localization sequences (NLS) and are therefore found mainly in the nucleus. Though it is known that a few hnRNPs shuttle between the cytoplasm and nucleus, immunofluorescence microscopy with hnRNP-specific antibodies shows nucleoplasmic localization of these proteins with little staining in the nucleolus or cytoplasm. This is likely because of its major role in binding to newly transcribed RNAs. High-resolution immunoelectron microscopy has shown that hnRNPs localize predominantly to the border regions of chromatin, where it has access to these nascent RNAs.The proteins involved in the hnRNP complexes are collectively known as heterogeneous ribonucleoproteins. They include protein K and polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB), which is regulated by phosphorylation catalyzed by protein kinase A and is responsible for suppressing RNA splicing at a particular exon by blocking access of the spliceosome to the polypyrimidine tract. hnRNPs are also responsible for strengthening and inhibiting splice sites by making such sites more or less accessible to the spliceosome. Cooperative interactions between attached hnRNPs may encourage certain splicing combinations while inhibiting others.","Heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein particle","Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein particle","NULL","HNRNPAB"

It is an antiviral enzyme that counteracts viral attack by degrading RNAs, both viral and host. The enzyme uses ATP in 2'-specific nucleotidyl transfer reactions to synthesize 2'-5'-oligoadenylates, which activate latent ribonuclease (RNASEL), resulting in degradation of viral RNA and inhibition of virus replication.The C-terminal half of 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase, also referred to as domain 2 of the enzyme, is largely alpha-helical and homologous to a tandem ubiquitin repeat.

An example of this would be ADAM12 which plays a significant role in the fusion of muscle cells during embryo development, in a process known as myogenesis.  Most metalloproteases require zinc, but some use cobalt. The metal ion is coordinated to the protein via three ligands. The ligands coordinating the metal ion can vary with histidine, glutamate, aspartate, lysine, and arginine. The fourth coordination position is taken up by a labile water molecule.  Treatment with chelating agents such as EDTA leads to complete inactivation. EDTA is a metal chelator that removes zinc, which is essential for activity. They are also inhibited by the chelator orthophenanthroline.","Metalloproteinase","Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalloproteinase","NULL","NULL"

The flavin is generally tightly bound (as in adrenodoxin reductase, wherein the FAD is buried deeply). About 5-10% of flavoproteins have a covalently linked FAD. Based on the available structural data, FAD-binding sites can be divided into more than 200 different types.90 flavoproteins are encoded in the human genome; about 84% require FAD and around 16% require FMN, whereas 5 proteins require both. Flavoproteins are mainly located in the mitochondria.

These are called synaphin 1 and 2. In the presence of Ca2+, the transport vesicle protein synaptotagmin displaces complexin, allowing the SNARE protein complex to bind the transport vesicle to the presynaptic membrane.  Complexin acts as both an inhibitor and a facilitator of synaptic vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release. In one conformation, it clamps SNAREpin complexes, preventing vesicle fusion, while in a different conformation it releases the SNAREpins, allowing synaptotagmin to trigger fusion.   Whereas complexin is not necessary for synaptic vesicle exocytosis, it does increase neurotransmitter release by 60–70% as demonstrated by complexin gene knockout in mice. A number of human neurological diseases have been linked to a deficiency of complexin.  Synaphin can promote exocytosis by promoting interaction between the complementary syntaxin and synaptobrevin transmembrane regions that reside in opposing membranes prior to fusion.","Complexin","Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexin","NULL","CPLX1"

In addition, reticulons may play a role in nuclear pore complex formation, vesicle formation, and other processes yet to be defined. They have also been linked to oligodendrocyte roles in inhibition of neurite outgrowth. Some studies link RTNs with Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.All eukaryotes studied so far carry RTN genes in their genomes. The reticulons are absent only in archaea and bacteria. Mammals have four reticulon genes, RTN1, RTN2, RTN3, RTN4. Plants possess a greater number of reticulon isoforms, with 21 having been identified in the commonly used model organism Arabidopsis thaliana.The genes possess a number of exons and introns and are accordingly spliced into many isoforms. C-terminal region of RTNs contains a highly conservative reticulon homology domain (RHD) while other parts of the protein may vary even within a single organism.A peculiar feature of RTN4's isoform RTN4A (Nogo-A) is its ability to inhibit axonal growth. This reticulon subform is curiously absent in fish, a taxon known for the heightened ability of its CNS to regenerate after injury.  Transmembrane 33 (TMEM33) exogenously suppresses reticulon 4C function and therefore may play a role in dictating membrane curvature through inhibition of reticulon function.","Reticulon","Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reticulon","NULL","RTN1"

Angiogenesis proceeds through sprouting, endothelial cell migration, proliferation, and vessel destabilization and stabilization. They are responsible for assembling and disassembling the endothelial lining of blood vessels. Angiopoietin cytokines are involved with controlling microvascular permeability, vasodilation, and vasoconstriction by signaling smooth muscle cells surrounding vessels. Angiopoietin-1 is critical for vessel maturation, adhesion, migration, and survival. Angiopoietin-2, on the other hand, promotes cell death and disrupts vascularization. Yet, when it is in conjunction with vascular endothelial growth factors, or VEGF, it can promote neo-vascularization.","Angiopoietin","Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiopoietin","NULL","ANGPT1"
